### Compounding Interest
 
## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
1. What did you do particularly well?
  I feel that the implementation of the Menu class was well done. I implemented a singulton disign when creating the class. 
  
2. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could improve the code by including more validations. This would resolve any potential bugs. I could also add functions to the menu items to be called when menu item is     selected.
  
3. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Implementing the Menu class as a singulton design was the most challenging. I overcame this by gaining a better understanding of what the intended purpose of the singulton design is and researching different ways to implement it. 
  
4. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The creation of a reusable class is a skill that i will utilize in other projects. 
  
5. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  By utilizing clean code standards and making the code dynamic will allow this code to be mmaintainable. Creating classes that are reusable allows the class to be used in many other palces.
